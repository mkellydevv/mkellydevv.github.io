I am a Software Engineer that specializes in full-stack web development and game programming. I received my
education in computer science at George Mason University, App Academy, and through self-study.
<br><br>
What defines me most as a programmer is my focus on creating modular and extensible code.
Beyond that, I enjoy finding the most efficient solutions to the problems I work on, and will not
stop working a LeetCode challenge until it's in the top ~1% of accepted solutions. When I work on a new project,
I always try to utilize a new technology or framework to keep myself improving.
<br><br>
In my spare time, I enjoy creating small indie games wherein I implement some novel idea. My other hobbies
include typical nerd affair like playing games, hiking, and fitness.
